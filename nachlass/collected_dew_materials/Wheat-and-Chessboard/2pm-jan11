Wheat and Chessboard Problem

started 400-600 Ad not known when

Sissa Ibn Dahir supposedly invented chess board.

Asked by King how he should be rewarded for such an invention
Reply was to put one grain of wheat on first square, 2 grains
on second square 4 on third square etc. King laughed at his small request and
replied he would be glad to do this as a reward to the inventor
of the chess board.  But King  could not satisfy this request.

This exemplifies difference between an arithmetic and exponial
growth.

I CHANGED MY MIND and term COMPACT REDUCER is better to use
below than COMPACT INVERTER.

In particular, my next paper will use the term  COMPACT REDUCER
  `` COMPACT REDUCER for a base axiom system of \gamma 
to describe and integer X that has the property that 
 \gamma can prove:

\forall Y  \exists Z such that X*Y= Z

The basic point if that it is easy to construct
systems \gamma that  can prove the identity that

\forall X if X is a compact reducer (for \gamma) then
so is X*X a compact reducer (for \gamma).

I developped this theorem while teaching Robert. The point
is that it leads to a simpler proof of a trivially
modified version circle-dot (where Item I is changed to require
that base axiom system A recognizes either addtion or
doubling as total functions). Either of these two changes
is good enough.  when formalism A can prove a fixed finite
subset of PA's Pi_1* theorems.

Possibly ``compact reducer'' to ``ironic reducer'' or
''ironic compactifier'' or ``compact multiplier'' 
but I like ``compact reducer''
best.

It also has advatage of introducing generalizations called
Compact ``(J,K)'' Reducers.
and similarily ``Compact (J,K) Reduction Theorems''.
or perhaps better, it can be called a
   ``Compacting (J,K) Reduction Theorem''.
