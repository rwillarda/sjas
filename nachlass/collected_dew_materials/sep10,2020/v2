On September 9, I listened to Artemov's Indiana talk from
4-6pm.  It helped me better understand his arXiv paper,
and its relationship to my work.  His Complete-Induction (CI)
is a useful concept if it is viewed as one leg of the 3-part
formalism for reviving logic, in view of Goedel's 1931
paradox.  The other two legs are my self-justifying systems
and the Pudlak-Solovay Theorem (that many of my papers
have called Result ++).

All three of these components are necessay and needed to
interact with each other to formulate a fully comprehensive theory
of Logic. My theory cannot stand by itself because it is
TOO WEAK in isolation. Artemov's results, although nice,
suffers a different type of weakness because they replace
one unified theorem with a pluarlistic ``SCHEMES'' method, whose
multiplicity is unfortunate. Likewise,the Second Incompleteness
Theorem (whose strongest form appears in ++) is unaccepbible
because it is an excessivly negative result (as indicated
by the Hilbert Godel complaints given in * and ** (as well
as in the Sacks-Goedel quotes).

The word `` TRIPOD '' is an excellant way of summarizing my
3-part
theory. It is well known that a camera cannot stand up
in a steady manner on planet Earth because gravity will
cause it to collapse in one direction or another.  But if
it has 3 legs, gravity will cause it to stand steady
because before collapsing to the ground it must left itself
up before the force of gravity causes it to become unstable.

Likewise, the 3-legs of the ``Tripod'' theory will
form a stable configuration. It is not a perfect theory:
It will force philophical compromises, BUT IT IS A CONFIGURATION
that can be made stable under the influnce.  Human Beings
have used an anology of this improvised 3-leg approach
since the dawn of human thought (we conjecture). My 3-part
``Tripod'' formalizes waht was done informally, since at
least the time when literacy began.

OLD NOTES
$~~~~$
On August 20, I reported that after I gave
Robert a class about logic (over Internet),
 I developed a much refined understanding about the Propositional
 Calculus version of the compactness theorem (appearing in Enderton's
 textbook). Now after an August 24 class, I developed a second improved
 proof of preceding, where the
  ``unknown'' symbol (for when a Boolean value is unknown) is
 called
``Zip'' or
 ``Zippy'', and a fourth symbol is a never-employed
 symbol,   called ``Oops''
 Here False, True, Zippy and Oops carry
 the numeral values of 0, 1, 2, and 3 in a
 ``quadruple'' analog of a decimal encoding.

 
 I also
 want to record that I plan to telephone Peter Bloniarz tomorrow
 about a glitch in New York State security that he may not know about.
 It is that workers in the NYS bureaucracy are using their insecure home
 computers when servicing customers via transferred telephone calls.
 Since these workers have access to social security numbers, an
 obvious security breach is possible.

 
 I also developed after talking to Robert an improved
 proof of  Enderton's
 A-version of the Completeness Theorem.
 I don't have time to go into more  details here
 about any of these topics   because I need to do my taxes today.
 This records a continuation of my on-going research,
