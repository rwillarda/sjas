On August 20, I reported that after I gave
Robert a class about logic (over Internet),
 I developed a much refined understanding about the Propositional
 Calculus version of the compactness theorem (appearing in Enderton's
 textbook). Now after an August 24 class, I developed a second improved
 proof of preceding, where the
  ``unknown'' symbol (for when a Boolean value is unknown) is
 called
``Zip'' or
 ``Zippy'', and a fourth symbol is a never-employed
 symbol,   called ``Oops''
 Here False, True, Zippy and Oops carry
 the numeral values of 0, 1, 2, and 3 in a
 ``quadruple'' analog of a decimal encoding.

 
 I also
 want to record that I plan to telephone Peter Bloniarz tomorrow
 about a glitch in New York State security that he may not know about.
 It is that workers in the NYS bureaucracy are using their insecure home
 computers when servicing customers via transferred telephone calls.
 Since these workers have access to social security numbers, an
 obvious security breach is possible.

 
 I also developed after talking to Robert an improved
 proof of  Enderton's
 A-version of the Completeness Theorem.
 I don't have time to go into more  details here
 about any of these topics   because I need to do my taxes today.
 This records a continuation of my on-going research,
